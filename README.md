# Master-Slave-SPI-Interface-ATmega16
ATmega16 library for interfacing over SPI.

Library is inside "SPI" folder, while example code is inside "Example" folder.

IMPORTANT: Inside example code, LCD library which is inlcuded is not provided in any of the folders, but any other library for interfacing with LCD display will work just fine.

Hope this code helps you.
